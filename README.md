# VRDV
A repository for a combined project on the virtual reality and data visualisation courses at UNIL

This project aims to visualise the planets of our solar system. To do this I used D3 to extract data from this [file](https://github.com/devstronomy/nasa-data-scraper/blob/master/data/csv/planets.csv) that is also downloaded in this folder. I tweeked the numbers to see more amplified movements, if it were the real numbers we wouldnt be seeing much movements, also I reduced the distance between planets (/5) otherwise it take too long to travel to planets. Planets are at the correct proportions to each other. At launch all planets start on the same X axis so you can travel on more or less a straight line from Mercury to Pluto.

Feel free to tweek the numbers as you please in the code to reduce distance or accelerate rotations.

Challenge - Find Pluto (Hint : follow CÃ©line)

To run the project, open the folder in VS Code and go live with Live Server extension.
